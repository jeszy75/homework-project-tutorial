A traditional [dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice) is put on the top left
square of the game board with 6, 4, and 2 on the top, front, and left sides,
respectively. The goal of the puzzle is  to get the dice to the bottom right
square. In a move, the dice can be rolled to a neighboring square if the number
on the top side of the dice equals the number of the target square with the
following exception: the dice can  always be rolled to an empty square no matter
which number is on the top side.
